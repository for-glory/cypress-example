# example tests using cypress __[and keeping it simple]__

# Setup

npm install

# run tests

//todo

__Following best practices__

0. KISS [keep it simple, stupid]
2. Using shortcuts to test only one feature at a time
3. Tests are easily readable - __not__ using page objects pattern but keeping selectors (only selectors) separately as they are not easily readable
